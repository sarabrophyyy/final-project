#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created one level for my platformer game and put placeholder animations where I plan on inserting my own drawings as animations.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not added more levels. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My biggest issue was getting pip and pygame to install properly, but I solved it by watching many YouTube videos and reading many Reddit threads.
